# Health Data Gen

Health Data Gen is a Python library for generating synthetic health datasets. This can be useful for testing, prototyping, and training machine learning models when real-world data is not available or cannot be used due to privacy concerns.

## Features

- Generates a dataset with attributes related to demographics, medical history, vital signs, treatments, complication risks, and readmission outcomes.
- Easy to customize and extend with additional attributes.

## Installation

To use this script, you need to have `pandas` installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to generate a dataset with 50,000 rows:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azizharouna/HealthDataGen.git
cd HealthDataGen
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python generate_dataset.py
```

The script will generate a dataset with 50,000 rows and print the first few rows to the console.
